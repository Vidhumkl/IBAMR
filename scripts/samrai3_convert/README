(1) In the migration to SAMRAI3, the SAMRAI_MPI utility class no longer
contains static functions. In order to use this class, one must now instantiate
a SAMRAI_MPI object. We have introduced a class called IBTK_MPI that is the
same as the SAMRAI2 SAMRAI_MPI class. It contains the same kinds of static
functions except a few have been deleted. If you are using a SAMRAI_MPI call
that is not supported by IBTK_MPI, this should result in a compile time error.
The script samrai3_convert/update_mpi_calls.pl is a perl script that searches
for SAMRA_MPI calls and replaces them with IBTK_MPI calls. It can be run using
the following command: perl <script name> <directory to change>

As with all automatic code editing, please make sure you have a backup of your
files before running this script.


(2) We have also introduced an initialization class IBTK_Init that will handle
the startup and shutdown of the required libraries SAMRAI, PETSc, and libMesh
as well as set the default MPI communicator used by IBTK_MPI. An IBTK_Init
object should be created at the beginning of the main routine and destroyed at
the end of main routine. See the examples for an example of how the new startup
process works. In particular, the PETScInitialize, SAMRAI_MPI, SAMRAI Manager,
and LibMeshInit calls are no longer needed and are replaced by a call to
IBTKInit::initalize(). In the case that the LibMeshInit object is needed, there
is a static function IBTKInit::getLibMeshInit() to retrieve a pointer to the
object.
